# Password-Generator_2.0

An improved version of the first password generator.
Hello! It's Godwin again. This is a slightly detailed verion of my password generator project.
The key diffence is that I've traded to ability to create multiple passwords at once for being able to specify how many uppercase or lowercase letters or symbols the password should include.
I thought having this feature would be nice for people who are required to meet specific requirements.
Also, I imported shuffle because the password was coming out in specific patterns depending on the numbers given in the preferences. For example, a preference of 3 lowercase letters, 3 uppercase letters, and 3 symbols would come out in the format "aaaAAA***" which could be easily predicted if the preference numbers are known and I believe that having a predictable pattern would defeat the purpose of the password generaor.
Hope you enjoy it!!
